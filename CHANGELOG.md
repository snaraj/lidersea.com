[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
SemVer and match image/chart tags exactly.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-11

### Changed
- Serve the application shell as `no-cache` instead of `no-store`, so the
  edge and browser may store it while still revalidating every navigation.
  An unchanged site now answers with a small `304` instead of shipping the
  whole document from the origin through the tunnel each time; the shell
  was the one uncacheable resource on an otherwise fully cached site. The
  document is public and its `ETag` is a content digest, so nothing is
  traded for the gain. Content-hashed assets keep their immutable caching.

### Added
- `TestNoRequestMethodCanEverMutate` pins that every route refuses every
  mutating method — the executable safety contract that makes TLS 1.3
  0-RTT (early data, which can be replayed) admissible at the edge.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- Release pipeline: capture helm push's stderr so the chart digest is
  read for signing and the Release notes. v0.1.5 published a signed
  image and an unsigned chart artifact before the digest parse refused;
  tags are immutable, so v0.1.6 is the first complete signed release
  (image + signed OCI chart + GitHub Release).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- Release pipeline: removed the invalid GitHub attestation step (buildx
  SLSA provenance + SBOM and the Cosign signature remain the integrity
  evidence). v0.1.4 published a valid signed image but no chart or
  GitHub Release; tags are immutable, so v0.1.5 is the first complete
  release.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- Go module renamed to the standalone identity github.com/snaraj/lidersea.com.
- Standalone repository: complete history imported from the
  `website-infrastructure` monorepo with authorship preserved.
- Production CI: PR gate (frontend + Go tests with coverage, chart lint,
  dual-arch container build, secret/history scanning, actionlint,
  dependency review) and CodeQL.
- Tag-triggered release publisher: multi-arch image + OCI Helm chart to
  GHCR, Cosign keyless signing, SBOM, SLSA provenance, GitHub Releases.
- Documentation: README, agent contract (AGENTS.md), security policy,
  MIT license with all-rights-reserved site content.

## [0.1.3] and earlier

Released from the monorepo publishers (`ghcr.io/snaraj/lidersea-com`
`v0.1.2`, `v0.1.3`): hello-world frontend contract, health/readiness
endpoints, embedded-serving hardening, fail-closed media subsystem. See
the monorepo history (imported here) for details.
